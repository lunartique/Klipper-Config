# Klipper-Config
klipper config file for SideWinder X1+BLTouch+E3D Hemera.cfg
I've mix the config from multiple sources
- https://3dprintbeginner.com/install-klipper-on-sidewinder-x1/
- https://github.com/ascii-ts/my-klipper-configs#readme

and many other config that I have saved tidbits and try swapping them around until my printer moved. Some more adjusting still needed so please expect to tinker around with it.

Please feelfree to use,but the most important message of all keep in mind I don't know WTF i'm doing. risk is your own lol.
Keep your power switch close.
